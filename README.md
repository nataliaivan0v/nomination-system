- Test framework: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

Frontend:

- Library: [React](https://react.dev/)
- Component library: [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- CSS library: [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

Backend:

- Framework: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

## Setting up the development environment

Prerequisites: make sure everything is installed

1. [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en)
    - To check if it's installed: `node -v` and `npm -v`
    - To install: for [mac/linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (setup instructions are in the link under the `Installing and Updating` and `Installation & Upgrades` sections, respectively)
3. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
    - To check if it's installed: `yarn -v`
    - To install: `npm install --global yarn`
4. [nx](https://nx.dev/): `npm add --global nx@latest`

First, clone the repo and `cd` into the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SGAOperationalAffairs/nomination-system.git
cd nomination-system
```

Then, install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

## Running the app

To run just the frontend,

```bash
nx serve frontend
```

To run just the backend,

```bash
nx serve backend
```

To run both the frontend and backend with one command,

```bash
nx run-many -t serve -p frontend backend
```

The frontend will be at http://localhost:4200/ and the backend will be at http://localhost:3000/.
